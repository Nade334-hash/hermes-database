Following a decorated tenure in the USMC and Navy SEALs, his trajectory shifted violently after the Ukraine Incident. ||The confirmed arrival of his brother, Will, in Ukraine|| for treatment and his subsequent \"disappearance\" served as the catalyst for Rodriguez’s disillusionment with NATO’s bureaucratic limitations.\n\n*Psychological Profile:*\nExhibits |\"Clinical Detachment.\"| He is noted for his \"surgical\" approach to high-intensity conflict, a trait first recognized by Major Marcus Novak. Rodriguez no longer views conflict as a matter of ideology, but as a series of logistics and leverage. He is the ghost in the machine of the ENTICORE development, using his grief for his brother to fuel a global hunt for the \"Architects\" of the medical disappearance.",
